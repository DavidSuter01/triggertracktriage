## Inspiration
Standing by and doing nothing while an app could be developed to save lives was not going to happen.

## What it does
**Workplace Trigger & Track health Triage to Stop the Spread will help the workforce mitigate any potential lose of staff, work floorspace and lose of time dealing with the scenario**

## How I built it
The preferred stack React / nodeJS / HTML5/ SQLite / as the tool to compile and optimize features.

## Challenges 
European identification of contacts between diagnosed patients and people API's who came in contact with them in the 14 days still needs to be found. Or maybe cross-referencing of GPS history with the locations of COVID-19 patients will have happen locally.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
An accomplishment would be the evening I developed the app for Led Zeppelin reunion concert where we got 1 Billion page views in 6 weeks.

## What I learned
Co production is where its at.

## What's next for Workplace Trigger & Track health Triage to Stop the Spread
I think next we'll look to see if their is a potential deployment beta within a work place environment.
